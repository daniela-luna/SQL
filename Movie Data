# Dataset Name: 'Movie Data Analytics Dataset'
# Source: Kaggle.com 
# For this project, I analyzed movie data from the IMDB dataset downloaded from Kaggle. 
# The analysis focuses on movie ratings and earnings across different age groups and genres. 
# Data Cleaning: 
# Null Handing: Rows with missing (NULL) values in the genre column were excluded to ensure accurate calculations of ratings and earnings by genre.
